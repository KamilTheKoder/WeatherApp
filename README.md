# WeatherApp

This is my weather application that allows you to easily check the current weather conditions in your local area.

## Overview

This is my weather app, crafted with Angular, TypeScript, and CSS. If you find yourself growing bored of checking the current weather in Warsaw, you can simply use the search bar to look up your own city. I accomplished this by fetching data through an API.
