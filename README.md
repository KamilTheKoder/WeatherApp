# WeatherApp

This is a project I've created using Angular

## Overview

Hey there! This page is made with Angular, TypeScript, and CSS – just a fun way to refresh some basic concepts. No need to keep an eye on the weather in Warsaw all the time. The info comes from an API, so go ahead and check what's happening in your city instead!

## Built with

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
